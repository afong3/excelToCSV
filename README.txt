Created to efficiently change all excel files into CSV's. 

Once an excel file in a given path is detected, the script converts the sheets into individual CSV's 
using the sheet's name as the filename. The path to the created files are under a new 
directory called "duplicate/" but maintains identical subdirectory paths which the
excel files were originally organized in.
